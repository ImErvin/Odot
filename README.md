### Introduction
This application was developed as part of my Mobile Application Development module in Year 2 of Software Development.
The intention behind this project was to get a better understanding of the real world technologies being used to develop mobile applications. 

This repository is a little outdated, this was my first piece of work that I was proud of (even though it was very simple and has a lot of bugs that I found coming back to it after almost 2 years). This is repository is more of a sentimental milestone.
